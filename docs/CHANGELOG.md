# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- **Orchestrated commands are now real Spec-Kit commands.** Registered `speckit.sdd-orchestrator.specify`, `.implement`, `.codebase-index`, `.codebase-architect`, `.discovery`, and `.route` in `provides.commands`. Previously these existed only as prose in `copilot-instructions.md` and as prompt files, so the runtime had no command to dispatch and the SDD pipeline ran inconsistently (or not at all).
- **Removed the non-functional `/speckit.specify` "override".** Spec-Kit cannot rewrite a built-in slash command; the override was advisory text the agent obeyed unreliably. Users now run `/speckit.sdd-orchestrator.specify` and `/speckit.sdd-orchestrator.implement` directly as the orchestrated entry points.
- **Fixed invalid command names.** `codebase.index`/`codebase.architect` (four dot-segments) violated the `speckit.<id>.<command>` schema; renamed to `codebase-index`/`codebase-architect`, along with their agent and prompt files, so command → agent resolution is 1:1.
- Updated all `Spawn:` references in the orchestrator agents to the registered command names.

### Changed

- Raised the Spec Kit requirement to `>=0.8.18`. Earlier versions do not wire `before_specify`/`after_specify` hooks into the specify command template (see spec-kit PR #1886), so the `after_specify` hook would silently no-op.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-01

### Fixed

- Correct command naming to `speckit.sdd-orchestrator.*` so the extension passes Spec-Kit installation validation

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Initial release of the `sdd-orchestrator` Spec Kit extension
- Added custom SDD workflow agent definitions in `.github/agents`
- Configured `after_tasks` hook to run `sdd.route`
- Added integration documentation and extension manifest
